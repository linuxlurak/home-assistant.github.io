Hardware required:
 - Sonoff Basic (wlan version) from Itead,
 - hot glue gun,
 - a cross screw driver (for Sonoff screws),
 - one pieces of dead simple mosquito repellent vaporizer (eg "Optimum Mückenstopp" (recommended), "Raid Mückenstecker").
 
 Software required:
  - .ino file from https://github.com/KmanOz/Sonoff-HomeAssistant
  or (not tested) from: https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota.
  
 Prepare your Sonoff:
 Open the case and cut a square into the bottom cover like this:
  
  

You need two automations. One powers on the vaporizer. The other powers it off.

```yaml
automation:
 - alias: "NO-Squito timer (power on @ 22:00)"
   trigger:
    platform: time
    after: '22:00:00'
   action:
    - service: switch.turn_on
      data:
         entity_id: switch.switch_sleeping_mosquitoheater
         
 - alias: "NO-Squito timer (power off @ 04:00)"
   trigger:
    platform: time
    after: '04:00:00'
   action:
    - service: switch.turn_on
      data:
         entity_id: switch.switch_sleeping_mosquitoheater
```

Thats it.
